Knowing what Zettelkasten is in [[denote:20250223T144948][zettelkasten intro]] and simple reference management through org-cite in [[denote:20250223T151901][orgmode reference]], now it's time to summarize my Zettelkasten workflow:

- create notes using =denote= with title and tags about a single concept/idea/though
- add reference/src through inline link (=org-insert-link=), footer (=org-footnote-new=), or citation (=org-cite-insert=) saved in system bib
- add connection to existing notes through =denote-link=
- use dired and search function (or system fuzzy finder) based on keyword (title) and/or tags to find specific note and/or pdfs
- check backlinks using =denote-backlinks= to follow the development of an entry note
- create meta notes to provide an entry point to other notes about a similiar topic
- create permanent notes when enough thoughts are connected
