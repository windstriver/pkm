* Objective
As required by "reference/source" part of Zettelkasten [[denote:20250223T144948][zettelkasten intro]], a reference management system is needed in orgmode, especially for literature (citation, attachment pdfs).

Orgmode already provides powerful linking functionality through =C-c C-l= (insert link), which can be used in either inline or footer.

After basic study of org-cite (builtin), org-ref, citar, etc., the builtin approach org-cite seems like a lightweight solution, even it has weak pdf management support, which can be addressed through a finder program.

* org-cite with citar
Global bibliography file:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-cite-global-bibliography '("~/path/to/system-references.bib"))
#+END_SRC

Here is a test citation to deepseek r1 technical report [cite:@deepseek_20250122].
