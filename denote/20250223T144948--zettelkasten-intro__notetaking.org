Traits of Zettelkasten:
- It's hyper-textual.
- It adheres to the /Principle of Atomicity/ (each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge and one only).
- It's personal.

* Anatomy of a Zettel [fn:1]
- Unique Identifier (e.g., time-based ID)
- Body / Content (you write it in your own words)
- Footer / Reference (reference management system)

* Types of Zettel [fn:2]
- Fleeting notes: transient thoughts for a future review
- Permanent notes
- Bibliographic notes: a special category of permanent notes that link to some literature
- Journal notes
- Meta notes: entry point to other notes about a similiar topic
