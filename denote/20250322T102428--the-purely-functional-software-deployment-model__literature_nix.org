Software deployment:
Environment issues:
- dependencies (runtime, build-time, compatible)
- find dependencies (e.g., dynamic linker search path)
- non-software artifacts (e.g., config files, user accounts)
- hardware requirement
Manageability issues:
- support the evolution of a software system

*Hash* is computed over all inputs:
- sources of the components
- script that performed the build
- any arguments or env vars passed to the build script
- all build time dependencies
